# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`

{result1 will evaluate to 42 and result2 will evaluate to 42 and undefined. logSum will print the result on a console whereas calculateSum will return the result to the function to be assigned to a variable.}
